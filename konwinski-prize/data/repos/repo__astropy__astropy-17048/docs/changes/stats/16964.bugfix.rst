Fixed a bug in biweight_location, biweight_scale, and
biweight_midvariance where the returned array shape would be wrong if
the input array had an axis length of 1 along any axis that was not
included in the axis keyword. Also fixed a bug in these same functions
where for constant data and axis set to a tuple containing all axes, the
returned value would be NaN instead of the constant value.
