### Action Plan  

✅ **Review Notebooks**: Explore the following resources:  
- [Konwinski Prize Demo Submission](https://www.kaggle.com/code/sohier/konwinski-prize-demo-submission)  
- [Patch Validation Snippet](https://www.kaggle.com/code/sohier/patch-validation-snippet)  
- [KPRIZE - Learn With Me - SWE-Bench and the KPRIZE](https://www.kaggle.com/code/dschettler8845/kprize-learn-with-me-swe-bench-and-the-kprize)  

✅ **Hands-on Practice in Kaggle**: Run models, experiment with the environment, and explore different functionalities.  

✅ **Local Notebook Approach**: Using training data and GPT for solving problems locally first.

❌ **Check Submitted Code**: Check other competitors' submitted code.

❌ **Final Submission**: Finalize and submit the solution (**Deadline: March 2**).


**Key takeaway**:

- Agent avoid hallucination by geting action's feedback from environment.

- Multi-turn agents solve complex tasks more effectively than single-turn agents.

- `gpt-4o` seems to use more tools to clarify tasks compared to `gpt-4`, `gpt-4o-mini`, and others.
