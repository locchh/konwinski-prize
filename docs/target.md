### **Target Output for Winning the Konwinski Prize Contest**  

The goal is to develop an AI system that can **correctly resolve GitHub issues** from real repositories while minimizing incorrect patches and unnecessary skips. Your submission will be evaluated based on the SWE-bench benchmark using the following formula:  

\[
\text{score} = \frac{a - b - \frac{c}{10,000}}{a + b + c}
\]

Where:  
- \( a \) = Correctly resolved issues  
- \( b \) = Incorrect patches  
- \( c \) = Skipped issues  

To **win the grand prize ($1M), your model must exceed 90% accuracy on the new benchmark set.**

### **Example Expected Output for a GitHub Issue Resolution**  

#### **Example GitHub Issue**  
**Repository:** `pandas-dev/pandas`  
**Issue #6789:** `DataFrame.apply()` throws a `TypeError` when used with certain lambda functions.  

**Issue Description:**  
When calling `.apply(lambda x: sum(x))` on a DataFrame, a `TypeError` is raised in recent versions. This was not an issue in version `1.3.0`.  

**Expected Behavior:**  
`.apply()` should work without errors when summing across axis `1`.  

---

### **AI-Generated Patch Submission (Correct Fix Example)**  
**Patch File:** `pandas/core/frame.py`  

```python
def apply(self, func, axis=0, raw=False, result_type=None, args=(), **kwds):
    if not callable(func):
        raise TypeError(f"Function must be callable, got {type(func)}")

    if axis == 1 and isinstance(func, (np.ufunc, types.LambdaType)):
        return self._apply_with_fallback(func, axis=axis, args=args, **kwds)

    return self._apply_standard(func, axis=axis, raw=raw, result_type=result_type, args=args, **kwds)
```

**Test Cases Added in `tests/frame/test_apply.py`:**  

```python
def test_apply_lambda_sum():
    df = pd.DataFrame([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
    result = df.apply(lambda x: sum(x), axis=1)
    expected = pd.Series([3, 7])
    pd.testing.assert_series_equal(result, expected)
```

### **Scoring Breakdown for This Example**  
- If this patch **correctly fixes** the issue, it contributes **+1 to "correct" (a)**.  
- If the patch **fails tests or introduces new issues**, it contributes **+1 to "incorrect" (b)**.  
- If the AI decides **not to attempt fixing the issue**, it contributes **+1 to "skipped" (c)** (which slightly reduces the score).  

---

### **How to Achieve a Winning Score (90%+)**
1. **Develop a model capable of applying meaningful bug fixes** to open-source repositories.  
2. **Minimize incorrect patches** by ensuring strong test coverage before submission.  
3. **Avoid unnecessary skips** while prioritizing high-confidence fixes.  
4. **Use an open-source model (MIT, Apache 2.0, or BSD license)** to comply with the competition rules.  
5. **Optimize inference speed and correctness**, since you can submit only **one patch per day**.
