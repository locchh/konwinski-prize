### **Explanation of Dataset Columns**

1. **`instance_id`**  
   - A **unique identifier** for each issue (GitHub issue ID).  
   - Example: `pylint-dev__astroid-2496`

2. **`repo`**  
   - The **repository** where the issue exists.  
   - Example: `pylint-dev/astroid`

3. **`problem_statement`**  
   - A **text description** of the problem reported in the issue.  
   - Example: `"TypeError: unsupported format string passed to..."`

4. **`patch`**  
   - The **code change (diff) that resolves the issue**, provided only in the **train set**.  
   - This is the actual fix applied to the repository to resolve the issue.  
   - Example:  
     ```diff
     - if value not in (np.ma.masked, None):
     + if value is not None and value is not np.ma.masked:
     ```

5. **`test_patch`**  
   - The **unit test changes (diff) that validate the fix**, provided only in the **train set**.  
   - These are modifications to test cases ensuring the bug is fixed.  
   - Example:  
     ```diff
     +def test_comparison_dimensionless_with_np_ma_masked():
     +    comparison = u.dimensionless_unscaled == np.ma.masked
     +    assert comparison is np.ma.masked
     ```

6. **`pull_number`**  
   - The **pull request number** that merged the fix into the repository.  
   - Example: `2496`

7. **`base_commit`**  
   - The **commit hash** used as the base version before applying the patch.  
   - Example: `8d3cdbbe6685fd8cf211816bec56c90f38f1859e`

8. **`issue_numbers`**  
   - The **original GitHub issue number** that describes the bug or feature request.  
   - Example: `[2492]`

9. **`PASS_TO_PASS` / `FAIL_TO_PASS`**  
   - **Lists of unit tests related to this issue.**  
   - `PASS_TO_PASS`: Tests that passed before and after the fix.  
   - `FAIL_TO_PASS`: Tests that **failed before** the fix and **passed after** the fix, verifying correctness.  
   - Example:  
     ```json
     "FAIL_TO_PASS": ["tests/test_inference.py::test_formatted_fstring"]
     ```

### **Difference Between `patch` and `test_patch`**
| Column       | Purpose |
|-------------|---------|
| **`patch`** | The **actual code fix** applied to the repository to resolve the issue. |
| **`test_patch`** | The **unit test modifications** to verify that the issue is correctly resolved. |

- **`patch` modifies the source code**, while **`test_patch` modifies the test suite**.
- `patch` is **the fix**, `test_patch` is **the validation**.
